title: Neat Algorithms - Flocking
date: 03/02/2011

In this post I'll explain a common but neat algorithm that simulates a group of entities grouping together, illustrating something called "flocking". I think it's quite neat because applying a few simple rules to govern each entity gives the group some complex and neat looking behaviour. 


Here's the full algorithm in action:
<div class="flock" id="fullFlock">

<script type="text/javascript">
  var Harry = {};
</script>

<script src="/js/processing.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="/js/flocking/vector.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="/js/flocking/boid.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="/js/flocking/flocking.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<link href='/css/flocking.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' />
