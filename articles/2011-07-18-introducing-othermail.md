title: Introducing OtherMail
date: 18/07/2011

Meet [OtherMail](http://othermail.me): the world's simplest way to deal with your overflowing inbox. [Adam](http://twitter.com/adamtmca) and I have been working on this for a while and we think its time to see what the world thinks!

From the [Othermail FAQ](http://othermail.me/faq):

    OtherMail is a new email address which is perfect for giving out to newsletters, beta invitations and any other low priority email lists. OtherMail collects all of the email which is sent to your @Othermail.me email address and sends you a simple summary email as often as you would like.
